I am a professor of Statistics at the Department of Statistics ([DEST][1]) of the Federal University of Paraná ([UFPR][2], 2017 - today) and a member of the Laboratory of Statistics and Geoinformation ([LEG][3]).  I lecture at Bachelor in Statistics and Data Science & Big Data Specialization ([DSBD][4]). I’m also a collaborator in the [Graduate Program in Statistics][7] of Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS][8]) and a peer reviewer of statistical and medical journals.

I am an applied statistician working mainly in the interface of statistics and health sciences research. I hold a degree in [Statistics][1] (2007) from the Federal University of Paraná ([UFPR][2]), master's degree (2011) and PhD (2015) in [Statistics][5] from Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG][6]). I conducted postdoctoral studies at the [Telehealth Center][9] of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG][6], 2016). I have been the major statistician in many clinical projects. These projects were translated in published papers in prestigious medical journals. 

My research interests are survival analysis, categorical data, missing data in longitudinal studies and causal inference.
