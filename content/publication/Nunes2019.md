abstract = "The 2012 World Heart Federation Criteria are the current gold standard for the diagnosis of latent rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Because data and experience using these criteria have grown, there is opportunity to simplify and develop outcome prediction tools. We aimed to develop a simple echocardiographic score applicable for RHD screening with potential to predict disease progression."
