abstract = "Pulmonary hypertension in response to exercise is a marker of the hemodynamic severity of mitral stenosis (MS). However, the factors related to elevated pulmonary pressure with exercise are not well defined. The aim of this study was to assess the parameters associated with the pulmonary pressure response to exercise in patients with pure rheumatic MS. An additional aim was to determine the impact of exercise induced pulmonary hypertension on clinical outcome."
