abstract = "The public health burden of atherosclerosis remains unacceptably high despite existing measures aimed at primary prevention. Although the detection of subclinical atherosclerotic disease as measured by quantification of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) by computed tomography (CT) refines risk estimation, this approach is costly and may not be feasible as a global strategy. We sought to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNC) using polychromatic flow cytometry in patients undergoing cardiac CT to determine cellular correlates of early atherosclerosis."
