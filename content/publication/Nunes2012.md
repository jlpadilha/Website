abstract = "Risk assessment of Chagas cardiomyopathy patients is essential for clinical decision making. The ratio of the ratio of early transmitral velocity to tissue Doppler mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/e') is a powerful predictor of adverse outcome in patients with heart failure. However, its prognostic value remains to be established in the setting of Chagas cardiomyopathy. This study investigated the effect of E/e' on mortality according to different degrees of left ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy."
