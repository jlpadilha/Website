  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:
Evaluate whether the polymorphism rs17782313 near MC4R gene influences long-term outcomes after bariatric surgery.

METHODS:
The rs16782313 polymorphism was genotyped in 217 individuals undergoing bariatric surgery and analyzed in detail in 141 women. Data for comorbidities, BMI, excess weight loss (EWL), and body composition were obtained before and during 60 months after surgery.

RESULTS:
The risk allele was found in 65 (47%) of the 141 women. Pre-surgical body weight and BMI were higher in carriers of the rs17782313 polymorphism (CC + CT group) than in non-carriers (TT group) (p = 0.039 and 0.047, respectively). The number of women who acquired surgical success (EWL > 50%), was lower in CC + CT group compared to TT group (p = 0.015). The minimum BMI seen during the 60 months of follow-up was higher in CC + CT group compared to TT group (p = 0.028). The number of women who presented BMI < 30 kg/m2 (no longer classified as obesity) after 24 months of surgery was inferior in CC + CT group (6 out 35 patients - 17%) than in TT group (19 out 49 patients - 37%, p = 0.043). Moreover, the number of patients maintaining BMI > 35 kg/m2 were higher carriers (18 out 35 patients - 51%) compare to non-carriers (16 out 49 patients - 32%, p = 0.045).

CONCLUSION:
Women with extreme obesity carrying rs17782313 MC4R polymorphism present a higher pre-surgical BMI, are more unlikely to reach non-obesity BMI (<30 kg/m2) and tend to maintain a BMI > 35 kg/m2 that characterize treatment failure.},
