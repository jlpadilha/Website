  abstract = {Risk assessment of Chagas disease patients is essential for clinical decision making [1]. New markers of cardiovascular risk have recently been identified. However, whether these factors can contribute to overall risk prediction remains an important question [2]. Although the conventionally used prognostic variable has been left ventricular ejection fraction, other parameters may allow more precise risk estimation. In particular, the ratio of early transmitral velocity to tissue Doppler mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/eâ€²) has become an accepted noninvasive method to estimate LV filling pressures for a variety of cardiac diseases [3].},
