  abstract = {Chagas Disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is a major cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America and, due to migratory movements, is present also in developed world. The benefit of anti-parasite treatment with benznidazole (BZN) in cardiomyopathy is not well established. Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and NT-ProBNP levels are accurate markers of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and may be useful in the evaluation of effectiveness of interventions in patients with Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC).},
