This method presents computational simplicity and provides consistent parameter estimates that have a population-averaged interpretation. However, with missing data, the resulting parameter estimates are consistent only under the strong assumption of missing completely at random (MCAR). Some corrections can be done when the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR): inverse probability weighting GEE (WGEE) and multiple imputation GEE (MIGEE). A recent method combining ideas of these two approaches has a doubly robust property in the sense that one only needs to correctly specify the weight or the imputation model in order to obtain consistent estimates for the parameters. In this work, a proportional odds model is assumed and a doubly robust estimator is proposed for the analysis of ordinal longitudinal data with intermittently missing responses and covariates under the MAR mechanism. In addition, the association structure is modelled by means of either the correlation coefficient or local odds ratio. The performance of the proposed method is compared to both WGEE and MIGEE through a simulation study. The method is applied to a dataset related to rheumatic mitral stenosis.","tags":[],"title":"A general GEE framework for the analysis of longitudinal ordinal missing data and related issues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Carmo P Nunes","Craig Sable","Bruno R Nascimento","Emilly Malveira de Lima","Jose Luiz Padilha da Silva","Adriana C Diamantino","Kaciane KB Oliveira","Emmy Okello","Twalib Aliku","Peter Lwabi","Peter Lwabi","Enrico Antonio Colosimo","Antonio Luiz P.

However, since 2013, there has been a decline in the number of teleconsultations. The objective of this study was to compare features of user and non-user cities and healthcare practitioners, in order to investigate the factors related to non-use of the TNMG teleconsultation service and assess users’ satisfaction with the service. Methods: Cities were classified as users and non-users according to the utilization of the service from June 2013 to May 2014; 160 healthcare practitioners were interviewed in each group. Among the user cities, 80 user healthcare practitioners (UHP-UC) and 80 non-user healthcare practitioners (NUHP-UC) were selected. Results: There was a significant difference in support and motivation by the local healthcare manager to use the teleconsultation service (67.5% in UHP-UC vs. 34.4% in HP-NUC, p ?0.0001; and 53.8 % in NUHP-UC vs. 34.4% in HP-NUC: p = 0.013), and with respect to training. (67.5% in UHP-UC vs. 45.8% in HP-NUC: p = 0,002). In multinomial logistic regression, (i) male gender, (ii) training and (iii) support and motivation from the local healthcare manager were independently associated with teleconsultation use. Conclusion: This study showed that training, and support and motivation from the local healthcare manager were the most important factors related to the teleconsultation use. This is an important finding that will assist in future development of approaches to increase the use and quality of teleconsultation services.","tags":[],"title":"Description of factors related to the use of the teleconsultation system of a large telehealth service in Brazil--the telehealth network of Minas Gerais","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gisele K.

The main strategy to decrease VT incidence is timely thromboprophylaxis in at-risk patients. We sought to evaluate the reliability of risk assessment model (RAM) data, the incremental usefulness of additional variables and the modelling of an adjusted score (the NAVAL score). We used the RAM proposed by Caprini for initial assessment. A 5 % systematic sample of data was independently reviewed for reliability. We evaluated the incremental usefulness of six variables for VT during the score modelling by logistic regression. We then assessed the NAVAL score for calibration, reclassification and discrimination performances. We observed 11,091 patients with 37 (0.3 %) VT events. Using the Caprini RAM, high-risk and moderate-risk patients were respectively associated with a 17.4 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 6.1-49.9) and 4.2 (95 % CI 1.6-11.0) increased VT risk compared with low-risk patients. Four independent variables were selected for the NAVAL score: \"Age\", \"Admission clinic\", \"History of previous VT event\" and \"History of thrombophilia\". The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the NAVAL score was 0.72 (95 % CI 0.63-0.81). The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) for the NAVAL score compared with the Caprini RAM was -0.1 (95 % CI -0.3 to 0.1; p = 0.28). We conclude that the NAVAL score is a simplified tool for the stratification of VT risk in hospitalized patients. With only four variables, it demonstrated good performance and discrimination, but requires external validation before clinical application. We also confirm that the Caprini RAM can effectively stratify VT risk in hospitalized patients in our population","tags":[],"title":"Derivation of a risk assessment model for hospital-acquired venous thrombosis: the NAVAL score","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcio Vinicius Lins Barros","Ana Elisa Loyola Arancibia","Ana Paula Costa","Fernando Brito Bueno","Marcela Aparecida Correa Martins","Maria Claudia Magalhaes","Jose Luiz Padilha Silva","Marcos de Bastos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1437350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437350400,"objectID":"ae26436059c3ef5b0592e660fcf911bb","permalink":"/publication/barros2015/","publishdate":"2015-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barros2015/","section":"publication","summary":" A trombose venosa profunda (TVP) apresenta elevada morbimortalidade.

Thus, alternative RV sites have been evaluated. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the effects of RV pacing site (apical vs. non-apical) on functional class, left ventricular (LV) function, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 6 months and 1 year after lead placement.
